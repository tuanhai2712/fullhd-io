      </h5>
      <br />
      <h5>
        1. The Real Account password and the client's login user are unique and
        the password is locked so that not even FullHD staff can read them. This
        is the reason why FullHD cannot retrieve a client's password and must
        give the Client a new one to their email address if they forgets their
        password.
      </h5>
      <br />
      <h5>
        2. FullHD maintains the client's balance in cash or an equivalent asset.
        The company guarantees 100% of each client's balance can be withdrawn
        immediately.
      </h5>
      <br />
      <h5>
        3. It is the responsibility of the Client to keep logins secure, secure
        any associated email addresses (password protected, screen lock, etc.)
        of any personal computer or device on which the Client's account has
        been accessed. FullHD is not responsible for any unauthorized use of the
        Client's account that is not the fault of the exchange.
