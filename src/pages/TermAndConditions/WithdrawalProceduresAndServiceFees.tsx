      <h5>1. Withdrawal procedures</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>
        1.1 FullHD finance department processes all withdrawal requests sent
        within 1 hour. However, in case of a lack of data from the client side
        or delays from a third party, processing time may be longer.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        1.2 FullHD finance department will determine the method of withdrawal.
        The Client cannot request to change the withdrawal method. All funds
        must be returned to the source provided by the Client. In special cases
        the FullHD finance department researched to find the optimal method to
        handle Client withdrawals.
      </h5>
      <br />

      <h5>2. Service Fees</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>
        2.1 The amount shown as the "Payment" of the Client is the amount after
        deducting 1% of the Blockchain fee (may vary by blockchain network) and
        2% of the Matrix fee. Accordingly, the "Payout" amount will be the exact
        amount credited to your trading account.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        2.2 There is no fee to open or maintain an account at FullHD. In order
        for a Client to request a withdrawal from an account that is inactive,
        an account is closed, locked, or excluded, the Client must contact
        FullHD via email: support@FullHD.io
      </h5>
      <h5>
        2.3 The client authorizes FullHD to charge any account fees in
        accordance with these terms and conditions into the client's trading
        account.
