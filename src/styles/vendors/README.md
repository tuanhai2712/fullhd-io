#VENDORS

This directory contains all third party code from external libraries and frameworks — such as Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, etc. However, there is often a need to override vendor code. If this is required, its good practice to create a new folder called vendors-extensions/ and then name any files after the vendors they overwrite. The filevendors-extensions/_bootstrap.scss would contain all your Bootstrap overrides — as editing the vendor files themselves, isn’t generally a good idea.
